## Integrate Git Hooks without headache.

We all know, [**Git Hooks**](https://git-scm.com/docs/githooks) are specific to each Git repository, and they are not automatically transferred when cloning a repository. This means that contributors need to be aware of and set up the hooks in their local repositories.
Thats why a [**Git Hooks**](https://git-scm.com/docs/githooks) package are available in almost every package manager in every programming language.

We can use [**Git Hooks**](https://git-scm.com/docs/githooks) package, to achieve this. But sometimes, many packages are pre-configured and have their own rules or way to do the things (of course we can customize that).
Sometimes, it could be overkill if we only need to run hooks to fix code styling on every commit and we have all the pre-configured toolset that we actually don't really need it. It just feels like waste of resource, Right?

So, here I will show you to setup [**Git Hooks**](https://git-scm.com/docs/githooks) in our Laravel or many other PHP projects.

If you are using VSCode as the editor, the `.git` folder are invisible by default. So, if you want to show the `.git` folder, you need to update your VSCode setting. Here is how:
We can set from the `settings.json` like this code below

```json
{
    ... Your other configuration
    "files.exclude": {
        "**/.git": false
    },
    ...
}
```

Or, we can go to the VSCode Settings (UI)

|                     Go to File -> Preferences -> Settings                      |                     And remove the `**/.git` from the list                      |

First, we can copy the binary files from the `.git/hooks` folder and paste it to our root folder.
Now, we have hooks folder in our root project folder. It should be looks like this.

![Hooks file](/static/images/git-hooks/2023-11-20-03.jpeg 'Hooks file')

After that, we can do some clean up to those files, remove that `.sample` extension. For example, I only use the `pre-commit` hooks. And we can start modify it.
In my case, I use the `pre-commit` hooks that will call [Laravel Pint](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/pint) to fix some code styling.

```bash
#!/bin/sh

staged_files=$(git diff --cached --name-only)

if [ -n "$staged_files" ]; then
    ./vendor/bin/pint
    git add $staged_files
fi

exit 0
```

By default, our git are still looking for the hooks from the original hooks path `.git/hooks`. Now, we need to change current hooks path to our `./hooks` folder.

To do that, we can run this command to change the hooks path.

```bash
git config core.hooksPath hooks
```

Now, git will read the hooks path from `./hooks` folder. But, it only happened in our machine. To make sure it can be shared and used seamlessly, we need to put this command somewhere. And, as far as I know, the right place to put this command is in the `composer.json` file on `post-autoload-dump` scripts section.

```json
{
    ...
    "scripts": {
        "post-autoload-dump": [
            "Illuminate\\Foundation\\ComposerScripts::postAutoloadDump",
            "@php artisan package:discover --ansi",
            "git config core.hooksPath hooks"
        ],
        "post-update-cmd": [
            "@php artisan vendor:publish --tag=laravel-assets --ansi --force"
        ],
        "post-root-package-install": [
            "@php -r \"file_exists('.env') || copy('.env.example', '.env');\""
        ],
        "post-create-project-cmd": [
            "@php artisan key:generate --ansi"
        ]
    },
    ...
}
```

By that, we don't have to worry about the git hooks path. It will "automatically" changed to the `./hooks` folder. Our teammate would have the same hooks as we are.

We can actually do more than this example, this fix code style is just to demonstrate that git hooks integration is that easy.

So, I don't have to worry about my other teammate to have different code style, Laravel Pint along with my hooks would handle that.
